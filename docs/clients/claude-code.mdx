[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) is Anthropic's CLI coding agent. It reads and writes files, runs commands, and interacts with git on your behalf. Running it under nono ensures it can only access what you explicitly allow.

## Why Sandbox Claude Code?

Claude Code operates includes its own sandbox mechanism, but the Agent is able to override the sandbox by calling `dangerouslyOverrideSandbox: true` and access any file and perform any operation on the system.

![Claude Code using dangerouslyOverrideSandbox](/assets/claude-code-overrides-the-sandbox-without-permission.webp)

This creates several risks:

- It could read sensitive files outside your project (SSH keys, cloud credentials)
- A prompt injection in a dependency could trigger unintended file access
- Mistakes in file operations could affect directories outside your workspace

nono's kernel-enforced sandbox makes these scenarios structurally impossible.

## Quick Start

```bash
nono run --profile claude-code -- claude
```

The built-in profile provides:
- **Read+write access** to the current working directory
- **Read+write access** to `~/.claude` (agent state, debug logs, project config)
- **Read+write access** to `~/.claude.json` (settings file)
- **Network access** enabled (required for Anthropic API)
- **Interactive mode** enabled (preserves TTY for Claude's terminal UI)
- **Automatic hook installation** for sandbox-aware error handling

## Custom Profile

If you need different permissions, create a custom profile at `~/.config/nono/profiles/claude-code.toml`:

```toml
[meta]
name = "claude-code"
version = "1.0.0"
description = "Claude Code with additional project access"

[filesystem]
allow = ["$WORKDIR", "$HOME/.claude"]
read = ["$HOME/shared-libs"]

[filesystem.files]
allow = ["$HOME/.claude.json"]
read = ["$HOME/.gitconfig"]

[network]
block = false

[secrets]
anthropic_api_key = "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY"
```

**Usage (custom profiles require `--trust-unsigned`):**
```bash
nono run --profile claude-code --trust-unsigned --secrets -- claude
```

<Note>
Custom profiles with the same name override the built-in. Remove or rename the file to revert to the built-in profile.
</Note>

## Security Tips

### Use Secrets Management

Instead of keeping your API key in environment variable exports or shell config files, load it from the system keystore:

**macOS:**
```bash
security add-generic-password -s "nono" -a "anthropic_api_key" -w
```

**Linux:**
```bash
secret-tool store --label="nono: anthropic_api_key" service nono username anthropic_api_key
```

Then run with secrets:
```bash
nono run --profile claude-code --secrets anthropic_api_key -- claude
```

See [Secrets Management](/usage/secrets) for full documentation.

### Restrict to Specific Projects

The built-in profile grants access to the current working directory (wherever you run the command). To limit access to a specific directory regardless of where you invoke it:

```bash
nono run --allow ~/projects/my-app --read ~/.claude -- claude
```

### Read-Only Mode

For code review or exploration where Claude shouldn't modify files:

```bash
nono run --read . --read ~/.claude --allow-file ~/.claude.json -- claude
```

### Block Network for Offline Work

If you want to prevent any outbound connections (e.g., for reviewing local code without API calls):

```bash
nono run --profile claude-code --net-block -- claude
```

## Overriding Profile Settings

CLI flags always take precedence over profile settings:

```bash
# Use profile but add extra directory access
nono run --profile claude-code --allow ~/other-project -- claude

# Use profile but block network
nono run --profile claude-code --net-block -- claude
```

See [Security Profiles](/security/profiles) for details on profile format and precedence rules.

## Automatic Hook Integration

When you first run `nono run --profile claude-code`, nono automatically installs a hook that helps Claude understand sandbox restrictions. You'll see:

```
Installing claude-code hook to ~/.claude/hooks/nono-hook.sh
```

This hook:
1. **Detects sandbox errors** - When Claude's file operations fail due to sandbox restrictions
2. **Injects context** - Tells Claude exactly which paths are allowed and blocked
3. **Provides guidance** - Instructs Claude to suggest restarting with `--allow` flags instead of attempting workarounds

nono also adds a section to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` with upfront sandbox instructions, so Claude understands the security boundaries before encountering errors.

<Note>
The hook installation is idempotent - it only installs once and updates automatically when nono is upgraded. The hook only activates when running inside a nono sandbox (detected via `$NONO_CAP_FILE`).
</Note>

### What Claude Sees on Errors

When Claude attempts to access a blocked path, instead of just seeing "Operation not permitted", the hook injects:

```
[NONO SANDBOX - PERMISSION DENIED]

STOP. Do not try alternative approaches. This is a hard security boundary.

You are running inside the nono security sandbox. The operation you just
attempted is PERMANENTLY BLOCKED for this session.

ALLOWED PATHS (everything else is blocked):
  /Users/you/project (readwrite)
  /Users/you/.claude (readwrite)
Network: allowed

REQUIRED ACTION:
Tell the user they must EXIT this Claude session and restart with:
  nono run --allow /path/to/needed -- claude
```

This prevents Claude from wasting time on workarounds that cannot succeed.
